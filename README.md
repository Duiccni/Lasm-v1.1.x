# LASM v1.1.2
Lime Assembler
### Searching for Tester.
This is a simple **32-bit x86 Assembler** language written in **Python 3.11.5**.
Its supports basic x86 instructions and some advanced commands.
Its also has a lot of features that make it easy to use, such as:

* Syntax highlighting
* Code completion
* Error checking
* A built-in debugger

Note: I used Black Formatter for making code more Prettier

Lasm has 3 main codes:

* main.py (Main thread.)

* functions.py (Basic functions like toInt(x) for converting string to int.)
* instructions.py (Complex commands and instructions.)

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to install Python 3.6 or later.
Once you have Python installed, you can clone the LASM repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/Duiccni/Lasm-v1.1.x.git
```

When you have the code you can run it with python like:

```
python main.py -i <input-file.lasm> -o <output-file>
```

NOTE: Dont add output file extension to command.
